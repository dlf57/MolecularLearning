This library was created as a graduate student project.

This is a library used to create molecular representations for possible machine learning applications. The representations consist of:  
 - Bonds w/ Atom Typing
 - Bonds and Angles w/ Atom Typing
 - Bonds, Angles, and Torsions w/ Atom Typing
 - Bonds, Angles, Torsions, and Nonbonding w/ Atom Typing
