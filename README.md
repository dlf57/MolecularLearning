# MolecularLearning
This is a repository for the files I am learning to use and edit for research.

Currenty this consists of two working files where one creates a database using sqlite format
while the other creates a dataframe using pandas. The hope is to come up with a solution that
effectively organizes the data so that it can be read into a machine learning algorithm. The
hope for the ML is that we can accomplish it through general scikit-learn methods in hopes
that it can be used for more general molecular learning applications in the future.

# Future direction:
 - Test on a larger dataset
 - Modify parameters to increase prediction accuracy
 - Change dependent variable
 - Use glob module to read through files in multiple folders
