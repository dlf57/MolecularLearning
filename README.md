# MolecularLearning
This is a repository for the files I am learning to use and edit for research.

Currenty this consists of two working files where one creates a database using sqlite format
while the other creates a dataframe using pandas. The hope is to come up with a solution that
effectively organizes the data so that it can be read into a machine learning algorithm. The
hope for the ML is that we can accomplish it through general scikit-learn methods in hopes 
that it can be used for more general molecular learning applications in the future. Currently 
in the molML-tweaks branch the ML is working but further testing is needed to ensure everything
is working correctly.

If you want to test any of this out, the molML.py file under molML-tweaks branch should provide 
you with everything you need.
