# MolecularLearning
This is a repository for the files I am learning to use and edit for research.

Currently this consists of two working files where one creates a database using sqlite format while the other creates a data frame using pandas that can be easily read from for machine learning. The hope for mol_ml.py is that we can accomplish it through general [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) methods so that it can be used for more general molecular learning applications in the future.

### Future direction:
 - Test on a larger dataset
 - Modify parameters to increase prediction accuracy
 - Change dependent variable
 - ~~Use glob module to read through files in multiple folders~~

### Useful files:
 - mol_ml.py (Reads through files and uses Kernel Ridge Regression classifier)
 - mol_sql.py (Reads through files and stores in sqlite database)
 - ~~ML.py~~
 - ~~AtomizationE.py~~
